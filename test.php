                    the Strategic Seer. <br>Nothing escapes your notice. <br> Youâ€™re more cognizant than most of all
                    that goes into achieving a goal or building a business, <br>and your perception pierces through the
                    layers of a desired outcome to see the various strata of action required. <br><br>In your exalted
                    form, you are like a mystic at the edge of the village, the Oracle at Delphi - <br>a calm well of
                    knowing open to those who wish to taste your clarity. <p></p>

                    â€“ <br>the moving parts, the open loops, the hidden tasks â€“ <br>leaves you feeling on the hook
                    for doing it all. <br><br>Properly a strategist, you become an overburdened tactician. <br>You fill
                    your days juggling an impossible number of tasks, and in this pressure cooker of doing- <br>you
                    lose touch with yourself. <br>What do you enjoy? What are you actually good at? What needs to
                    happen next? <br>Clarity disappears into a blur, a swirling fog where everything is a top priority
                    and no task receives your full attention. <br><br>In the next chapters, weâ€™ll look at what you
                    need to do to prioritize and create clarity. <p></p>

                    helpful to implement strategies for narrowing your peripheral vision. <br><br>One strategy is to
                    turn off notifications on your phone and computer. <br>Email, texts, slack, social media, news
                    sites â€“ you name it. <br>Shut it all down. <br><br>Then, instead of reactively responding to
                    incoming notifications, <br>set up daily rhythms during which you deliberately open the aperture
                    just a bit and process new messages at your own pace. <p></p>

                    thousand things that need to get done. <br>But from here on out, your daily to-do list consists of
                    just two items: <br><br><b>Item One is prioritization.</b> <br>What is the one thing you absolutely

                    present in the face of mountainous to-do lists. <br>So, what do you do? <br><br>Work must happen,
                    but you donâ€™t want to budge. <br>Do you power through? Grind it out? <br>Strongarm your way into
                    action? <br>Those are definitely possibilities. Terrible ones. <br>Hereâ€™s a better option:<br<br> 
                    
                    Do nothing. Absolutely nothing. Dont lift a finger. <br>
                    Dont expend an ounce of energy. Instead, watch yourself do it. Watch yourself write that email, call that client, complete that invoice.<br>
                     Dont feel it as an action youre performing.<br> Feel it as an action youre observing happen.<br> 
                     Enjoy this posture of productive repose. <br><br>

It might sound "woo," but its a technique thats been utilized for thousands of years by monastic practitioners. <br>
Its one of the most effective way to overcome resistance to action available to the human mind.

                    Are you focusing on the right things? Prioritizing correctly?<br> 
                    Delegating effectively to yourself and others? <br>
                    To fully access the power of the Strategic Seer, youll need to answer these questions regularly.<br>
                     Ensure this happens by setting aside rhythmic periods for business reflection.<br>
                      Ideally, youll have a few different cadences in place for conducting these reviews (e.g., daily, weekly, bi-weekly, monthly, quarterly, bi-annual, and annual).<br><br>

To get you started, Ive included a bi-weekly PDF review template designed specifically for Strategic Seers like yourself.<br> Try it. Alter it. Implement it.<br> Dont get too caught up in making modifications.

Good Luck
